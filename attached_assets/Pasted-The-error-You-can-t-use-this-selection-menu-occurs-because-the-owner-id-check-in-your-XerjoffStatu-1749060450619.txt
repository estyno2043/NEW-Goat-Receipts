The error "You can't use this selection menu" occurs because the owner_id check in your XerjoffStatusView class is failing. Let's fix this issue:

Problem Analysis:
In your xerjoffmodal class, you're accepting an optional owner_id parameter

When the modal is submitted, it calls get_xerjoff_view() with either the provided owner_id or the interaction user's ID

However, the selection menu in XerjoffStatusView only works for the owner_id that was passed to it

Solution:
The issue is likely in how you're initializing the xerjoffmodal. Here are the fixes needed:

First, make sure you're passing the correct owner_id when creating the modal. In your main bot code where you create the modal, you should do:

python
# When creating the modal from your main bot code
modal = xerjoffmodal(owner_id=interaction.user.id)
await interaction.response.send_modal(modal)
Alternatively, you can modify the XerjoffStatusView to be more flexible. Here's an updated version:

python
class XerjoffStatusView(ui.View):
    def __init__(self, owner_id=None):
        super().__init__(timeout=300)
        self.owner_id = owner_id or interaction.user.id  # Fallback to interaction user

    @ui.select(
        placeholder="Choose receipt type...",
        options=[
            discord.SelectOption(label="Order Confirmation", value="ordered", description=""),
            discord.SelectOption(label="Payment Confirmation", value="payment", description="")
        ]
    )
    async def status_select(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, select: ui.Select):
        if self.owner_id and interaction.user.id != self.owner_id:
            await interaction.response.send_message("You can't use this selection menu.", ephemeral=True)
            return
        # Rest of your code...
Additional Checks:
Make sure you're not accidentally reusing the same view instance for multiple users

Verify that the interaction user ID matches what you expect by adding debug prints:

python
print(f"Owner ID: {self.owner_id}, Interaction User ID: {interaction.user.id}")
Best Practice:
Instead of storing the owner_id in the modal/view, you might want to always use the interaction user's ID directly, since these components should generally only be used by the user who triggered them:

python
async def status_select(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, select: ui.Select):
    # No owner_id check needed since the view is ephemeral
    if select.values[0] == "payment":
        await interaction.response.send_modal(XerjoffPaymentModal())
    elif select.values[0] == "ordered":
        await interaction.response.send_modal(XerjoffOrderModal())
This would simplify your code and prevent the permission issues you're experiencing.

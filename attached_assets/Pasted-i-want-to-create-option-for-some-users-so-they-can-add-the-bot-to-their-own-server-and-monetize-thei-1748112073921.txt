i want to create option for some users so they can add the bot to their own server and monetize their own userbase. we will call this guild subscription. create command /configure_guild which will show user message content like this with invite link to invite the bot to their own server. when user with guild access runs command confifgure_guild inside my main guild it will show this message. after the user invites the bot to their server they will run command configure_guild inside their guild and it will show them a embed message like this with title: "Configure Your Guild"
Description: "-# Click the button below to start the setup process"
and include the button "Start" which will bring out a form like this where user will configure generate channel ID, admin role ID, Client role ID, ImageLink Channel ID and after submiting this it will show embed message like this Title: "Success"
Description: "-# Information saved successfully"
and save the info and now since the new generator channel id is configured for the specific guild it will let user use the /generate command in that server specific generate channel, make it so the guild specific channels ID's are saved to a database or some good place so when the bot restarts it will load them properly. The imagelink channel will be channel where the bot will respond with image link in that server specific channel. create command add_access with a field to select user and a ammount of days(if ammount is 0 it will add lifetime access to a user in that specific guild) after running this command the selected user will have access to use /generate command inside that server specific guild. the bot inside that user guild after the admin of that server runs command add_access will send a embed message visible to everyone like this
Title: "Access Granted"
Description: "Successfully added {ammount} Days access to {user.id.mention\n\n
Â» Go to {server.specific.generate.channel.id} and Run command /generate\n"
make the the command add_access to be that specific server Admin only command (role check from the submited server specific configured form)
when a user redeems the Guild key it will send this embed notification message to configured Purchases channel
Message content: {user.id.mention}
title: Thank you for purchasing
Description: {user.id.mention}, Your guild subscription has been updated. Check below.\n
-# run command /register_bot in <#1374468007472009216> to continue\n\n
Subscription
`Guild`\n\n

configure the /keygen command to also let me choose to generate 30-days or Lifetime Guild keys.
when user redeem 30 days guild key it will also add the user to database with 30 Days subscription type (while making special place for the user in another database which will allow user to use the command configure_guild). when user redeems Lifetime guild key it will add lifetime access to user in database with lifetime access subscription type (while making special place for the user in another database which will allow user to use the command configure_guild). when a 30 days guild user's expires (countdown for 30 days) the bot will no longer be avaible to use in that user's specific server where he configured it meaning that the saved channels ID's wil cease to exist making the bot unuseable inside that user guild. 
configure it so when i use command /edit for a specific user and use information button it will also show me user's guild subscription and type and their server where they have the bot configured (if user has guild subscription)
